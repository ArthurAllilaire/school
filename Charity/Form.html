<p style="margin:0cm;">Dear {BUSINESS_NAME},</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">We hope you are having a wonderful day.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">We're reaching out to you on behalf of the City of London School's charity
    committee. We have
    an exciting
    partnership
    opportunity that we’re sure would be of interest to {BUSINESS_NAME}. Our annual school charity appeal is the
    most successful school charity appeal in the country, raising sums of up to £84,000. You can find out
    more at: <a

</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">In the effort to raise funds for Papyrus, a suicide prevention charity, we are
    hosting a Quiz
    and Curry Night on the 13th of November, the same day as the Lord Mayor’s Show. The event has historically
    enjoyed great popularity and been met with great success. One of the key events on the night is our raffle,
    where we usually compile an assortment of prizes
    and gifts as an incentive to increase donations. We would be very appreciative if {BUSINESS_NAME} could
    generously donate us with donations
    towards our raffle prize, which would greatly increase the funds raised to support the elimination of youth
    suicides in the UK through Papyrus. Previous raffle prizes have included: Vouchers, Wine, Champagne, Prosecco,
    Chocolates, Books, Games, Candles, Jewellery, Accessories (scarves etc).</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">We think that this is a prime opportunity to increase your brand’s exposure to
    a wider
    clientele and gain loyal customers from the event’s many attenders, such as our partners within the City of
    London Corporation,
    parents,
    pupils, teachers, and other friends of CLS.
</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">We therefore ask that if {BUSINESS_NAME} is interested in helping to raise
    funds to reduce
    youth suicides in the UK by donating raffle prizes to please contact us via email.

    <span style="font-size:16.0pt; color:#1E4E79">What does Papyrus do?</span>
</h1>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><b>Suicide is the single biggest killer of people under the age of 35 in the UK
        today. </b>We
    are asking for your help in changing that.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0cm;">Papyrus is the national suicide prevention charity. Their mission is to reduce
    the number of
    young people who take their
    own lives by shattering the stigma around suicide and equipping young people and their communities with the
    skills to
    recognise and respond to suicidal behaviour.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">However, suicide is still an epidemic that is touching all corners of Britain,
    with 10 deaths
    per 100,000 people per year in the UK. Suicide is
    touching young people everywhere and in all walks of life.</p>

<p style="margin:0cm;">Papyrus is changing this in three main ways:</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2
    style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: 18pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;margin:0cm">
    <span style="font-size:14.0pt; color:#2E75B5">Support:</span>
</h2>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Papyrus provides confidential support and advice to young people struggling
    with thoughts of
    suicide, and anyone worried about a young person through their helpline, HOPELINEUK. </p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><b><span style="color:#2E95B3">Just £5 raised can fund one life-saving call,
            text or email to
            HOPELINEUK.</span></b><span style="color:#2E95B3"></span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2
    style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: 18pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;margin:0cm">
    <span style="font-size:14.0pt; color:#2E75B5">Equip:</span>
</h2>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Papyrus engages communities, the UK Government and volunteers in suicide
    prevention projects
    and deliver training programmes to individuals and groups. This includes equipping local councils, healthcare
    professionals and school staff with suicide prevention skills.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2
    style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: 18pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;margin:0cm">
    <span style="font-size:14.0pt; color:#2E75B5">Influence:</span>
</h2>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Papyrus tackles the systemic causes of suicide as they are a member of many
    government
    advisory groups in the UK on suicide prevention, where they present evidence so that lessons can be learned and
    learning implemented to help save young lives.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Papyrus also use hard-hitting and dynamic social media campaigns to raise
    awareness of suicide
    and shatter the stigma around it.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="color:#0A0A0A">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="color:#0A0A0A">To find out more please have a look at their
    </span><a href="https://www.papyrus-uk.org/who-we-are-2/"><span style="color:#0070C0">website:
            https://www.papyrus-uk.org/who-we-are-2/</span></a><span style="color:#0A0A0A">.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="color:#0A0A0A">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">We believe that this makes them one of the most effective charities at
    preventing suicide.
    They have experienced a 25% rise in contacts to their helpline, highlighting the severity and pressing nature of
    suicide.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Therefore any voucher or other prizes {BUSINESS_NAME} would be willing to
    donate to help raise
    funds to support this life-saving cause would be very meaningful and greatly appreciated.</p>
