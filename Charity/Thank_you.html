<p style="margin:0cm;">Dear {BUSINESS_NAME},</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Thank you so much for your generous donation! It will really make a massive difference in helping
    Papyrus undertake
    their life-saving work.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">To find out more about how your donation will be used please follow our instagram page at:
    https://www.instagram.com/charityatcls/. We run many events throughout the year in effort to raise money for Papyrus
    and will update the page regularly to keep you updated on the positive impact you have helped create.</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0cm;">Our goal this year is to raies £100,000. £26,000 more than the record at CLS! (Ambitious, we
    know!)</p>

<p style="margin:0cm;"> But we are determined to raise as much money as possible to help <a
        href="https://www.papyrus-uk.org/">Papyrus</a> in their mission to reduce the number of young people who take
    their own lives. If you would like to
